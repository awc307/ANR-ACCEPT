# ANR-ACCEPT
Welcome to the website for the ANR project **"AnharmoniC and exChangE interactions in Phonon specTra"** (Grant No. ANR-19-CE24-0028).  
This project is xxxxxx 1/12/2020- 30/06/2024


The goal of the project is to go beyond the state of the art in the calculation of phonon spectra. We will develop a systematic finite-difference approach to evaluate the electron-phonon coupling in solids with the inclusion of exact exchange and we will obtain non-perturbative temperature-dependent anharmonic phonon spectra via the self-consistent harmonic approximation. We will apply the method to technologically relevant materials, namely: (i) the structural distortion in carbyne (linear pi-conjugated carbon chain), (ii) the optical spectra, wave functions and real-time dynamics of excitons in carbyne, (iii) the ferroelectric instability in bulk (SnTe) and single layer (SnTe) thermoelectrics, (iv) the accurate calculation of charge density wave critical temperatures in single layer and bulk TiSe2/TiTe2.
